                My Name is Shally. I did my masters in computer applications and learnt French language for 3 years. While I was studying, I got an opportunity to teach French over the weekends. I loved teaching a lot. Language classes are a lot of fun and it gave me a lot of satisfaction when I saw my students speaking a foreign language. Part of my job was also to train students for Visa interviews in French.

                I started my first full time job with Wipro Technologies in Bangalore, India in 2006 as a QA Engineer where I got opportunity to work with globalization team where I could use both computer skills and French knowledge. From there, I moved to Citrix Systems and spent 6 years helping improve the quality of several Citrix products.I also Got to take initiatives for several process improvements projects, QA activities.
